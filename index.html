               <p>Review:
                  The titular "silent patient" is a famous painter, Alicia Benson, murders her husband and then goes silent, refusing to ever speak again. Criminal psychotherapist Theo Farber takes an obsessive interest in restoring her voice upon transferring to her pschiatric facility to work with her. The initial unravelling of the story was entralling, but the yarn itself far too long to keep my attention, despite the impressive plot twist.

                  This book was a great read! Evelyn Hugo is a reclusive Hollywood icon who is finally telling her life's story. Monique, the reporter capturing her story is enthralled and finds escape from her personal life within Evelyn's. The story is structured in sections by each of Evelyn's husbands, which I think is a unique and interesting way to layout the story.

               <p>Review:
                  &quot;Where the Crawdads Sing&quot; tells the coming of age story of a North Carolina girl named Kya. When a local boy is found dead in a marsh, locals immediate suspect Kya, with whom she had a complicated history. Amidst the trial Kya continues to grow up and attempt to have a writing career and find love. I think this book had a great story line and theme, as well as beautiful prose and imagery. However, sometimes the dialogue was tough to read and pulled me out of the book.

               <p>Review:
                  An unsuccesful writer's mistress is murdered and the police think he did it. Who can defend him? None other than the super successful lawyer wife he was cheating on with said mistress, of course. I did not like Adam's character or the detective's investigation skills. Overall a pretty bad read with a lot of plot holes and predictable twists.
